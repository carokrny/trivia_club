## General information
Web development exercise for a faux San Francisco Trivia Club. This project was an exercise in developing skills for pairing HTML structure with CSS styling, in particular: 
 - semantic HTML
 - HTML forms with client-side verification
 - flexbox display
 - background images
 - fixed position elements
 - Google fonts
 - rem units
 - media queries for responsive display. 

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* VS Code version 1.58.1
* Git version 2.30.1
	
## Setup

## Future work 
As I learn backend development, the HTML form will be updated to have backend functionality. 

## Inspiration 
This project is inspired by Codecademy's Off-Platform Responsive Club Website project. Codecademy provided an open-ended prompt of a responsive website for a real or fictional club. All files written by me.
